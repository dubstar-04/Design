# How to Contribute to this Project

## How to Submit an Issue
Please submit an issue if you have an idea or something that does not seem to work correctly.

We'll do our best to work with you and help you, whatever the issue is. For the best possible results:

* Try to make your issue as specific as possible
* Provide steps you can take to reproduce the issue
* Tell us what your expectation was of what *should* happen, as well as what *actually* happened. Lots of issues can be resolved by understanding a user's expectations.
* Categorize the issue as a bug, feature or improvement idea

We suggest [submitting an issue](https://github.com/dubstar-04/Design/issues/new) with the idea or improvement so that we can discuss it first. At that point, assuming we agree it's a good fit, we will attempt to implement it, or guide you to help you do so within your own pull request(s).

## Contributing Code via a Pull Request
So, you've got some code you'd like to contribute to the project. First off -- Thank you! It means a lot to us that you'd take your time to help improve this project.

We'll try to avoid being super strict about accepting PRs because we value contributions from others, but some general guidelines are below:

* You should [submit an issue](https://github.com/dubstar-04/Design/issues/new) before beginning a pull request. This makes sure that we have a good heads up that you want to contribute, and also makes sure that if we don't think the idea is a good fit, you don't spend time writing code only to have the PR rejected later.
* You should fork the project first and create a branch for your changes off the `master` branch
* We suggest creating a PR early in the process and placing `WIP` or `In Progress` in the title of the PR (you can edit it later). This way, as you add changes, we can see the progress, and might be able to jump in to help if we see things going off the rails. This one's your call, though; do whatever suits you.
* Try to make many small commits, with notes, at each step of the way. This will help us understand your thought process when we review the PR. We'll squash these changes at the end of the process, so no worries about being verbose throughout.
