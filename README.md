# Design
2D CAD for GNOME

[![Design QA](https://github.com/dubstar-04/Design/actions/workflows/DesignQA.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/dubstar-04/Design/actions/workflows/DesignQA.yml)

Design is a 2D computer aided design (CAD) application built for GNOME.
Guided by the GNOME philosophy, it aims to deliver a powerful yet simple user experience.
DXF support ensures seamless interoperability with other CAD tools.

### Features
- Drawing Tools: Line, polyline, circle, arc, text, and hatch creation.
- Entity Editing: Move, rotate, trim, and extend objects with precision.
- Layer Management: Organize and control visibility of drawing elements.
- Dimensions: Create dimensions with support for dimension styles.
- DXF Support: Use the industry standard DXF format for interoperability.
- Touch Support: Use touch enabled devices to view zoom and pan drawings.

### History
Design was originally conceived as an [Ubuntu / Ubuntu Phone application](https://launchpad.net/design-app), written in C++, QML and JS.
When the Ubuntu Phone project was cancelled in 2017 it seemed that would be the end of the road for Design, however the creator wondered if Design could possibly live on as a [web app](https://github.com/dubstar-04/Design-Web).

Now with Linux phones gaining popularity and momentum, the team have reinvented Design as a GNOME application along with the original aim to provide a native CAD experience whether on the move with a mobile device or at a traditional workstation.
